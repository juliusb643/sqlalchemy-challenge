sqlalchemy-challenge

For this assignment, I was able to create all of the necessary queries and retrieve the necessary data. However, I did run into errors when trying to transpose the data onto a Flask web application. I'm not sure why, so feedback would be definitely appreciated so I can figure out how to fix it and resubmit. 

I was able to piece together this assignment by looking at our past class assignments, using ChatGPT, and Xpert Learning Assistant.
